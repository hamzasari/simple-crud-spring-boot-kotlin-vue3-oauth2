This is a very simple Todo list application that has a client application and api server.
Additional things can be added, but in this repository I only want to utilize the OAuth2.0 with a Spring Boot API application written in Kotlin and a Vue 3 frontend application.

This repository has 2 main folders and a zip file.
- simple-crud-client: written with Vue3 and Quasar UI framework
- simple-crud-resource-server: written with Spring Boot 3.1.1 and Kotlin
- simple-crud-resource-server.zip: this is the zip file generated from https://start.spring.io/

Both server and client applications uses OAuth2.0 for authentication.
